# BE A NICE HUMAN

Play ball.
---

# Meet the TINUSAUR

What is TINUSAUR?

Who is using it?

---
# Map - DIY
Write your ideas, themes, and concepts on sticky notes and post them on the window.

What do you think should go in our guide?

---
# Outline - DIT

Now, let's try to group the ideas into topics.

What are the working titles of the topics?

---
# Write - DYI or Pair Up

Who is going to write each topic?

This is where we write. Of course, there is room for questions and discussion, but please go easy on the talking.
---
# Compose - DIT
Time to put our topics together and do some checking, content editing, and re-structuring.

- Is there something we've missed? Or something we should cut off?
- Check the titles and the structure of the guide.
- Are we using the right lingo to talk to school kids?
- And only if we've got time - proofreading/copyediting (because this can be done online, at a later date)
